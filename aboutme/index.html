        <p align="justify">Hello everyone! My name is Ramon Sy. I live in the Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines. I am the Stake and Ward Pianist of the Church. I am an active member/pianist of VivaVocé Cagayan de Oro, a local community choir organized by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </p>
        <p align="justify">I enjoy serving the Lord and sharing His truth through music. Whenever time permits, I upload videos of me playing the piano on my YouTube channel, with the intention of uplifting others, especially in these trying times. Please do check out my YouTube Channel.
